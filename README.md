# DTMP-Prime
### We introduce DTMP-Prime (Deep Transformer-based Model for Predicting Prime Editing Efficiency), a tool designed to predict PegRNA activity and PE efficiency.DTMP-Prime,based on the BERT, is a Bi-directional Transformer based model with multi-head attention layers.
### Furthermore, we designed a novel encoding algorithm to encode PegRNA-DNA pairs.
